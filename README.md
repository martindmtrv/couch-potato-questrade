Portfolio Balancer for Questrade!

This nifty little program will calculate the quantity of shares you need to buy and sell to reach your target asset allocation for your Questrade self-directed investment account! IMPORTANT NOTE: this program does not make any trades on your behalf, it is simply a glorified calculator for your investments!

# Authentication

This Python app uses OAuth2 authentication to access real-time/delayed market data from Questrade and your current portfolio allocation!

Simply run main.py, and your default browser will open to a Questrade API login page where you will login with your Questrade account. You will be redirected to the landing page where you must click a button to copy your authentication code to your clipboard. Paste this into the terminal and away you go!

# Account selection

If you have multiple accounts with Questrade; no problem! Once authenticated you will be able to select which account you want to use the calculator for!

# Balancing

This program aims to make rebalancing a bit easier! You can set a target asset allocation amongst your current holdings from the main menu! Whatever is leftover from 100% allocation will be assigned to cash allocation.

# Development

I'm looking at different platforms for this program to develop it as maybe a web app or an Android app; anything to take it out of the command line right?
